## What is CodeItLive

CodeItLive is community - it's a space where we share knowledge, expertise, experience, learn new tech, and hang out with other techies on stream and in chat. You can tune in almost every day for something different - from .NET to JavaScript, from beginner to advanced, from casual and fun, to in-depth and elaborate.

Your hosts are members of the developer relations team at Progress who have expertise in web, mobile and desktop development (.NET, JavaScript, NativeScript and more) and are insiders in their respective developer communities. On each show, they will share their knowledge, expertise and experience with you in an interactive and engaging way.
