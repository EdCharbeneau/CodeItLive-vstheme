## What is CodeItLive
Code It Live is a channel created by developers, for developers. Each week, we will bring you live coding, pair coding, interviews, charity streams and more.

Your hosts are members of the developer relations team at Progress who have expertise in web, mobile and desktop development (.NET, JavaScript, NativeScript and more) and are insiders in their respective developer communities. On each show, they will share their knowledge, expertise and experience with you in an interactive and engaging way.
